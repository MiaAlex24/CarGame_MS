Car Game

Description
This is the first game I've made and it's still a demo so it's not perfect.In Car game,you drive a car around a small town while having the ability to freely explore the small map.Drive around the town and collect stars or run into lamposts amd trashcans.However,try not to fall off the map as there is no respawn,sorry like I said it's still a demo.

Getting Started
.There is no specific os version to be able to play the game as it is on a website for now.If there is an installation version of the game in the future,I will update this section to explain what is needed before installation.
.There is no need for installation as the game only on a website for now if you want to play it here is a link:
